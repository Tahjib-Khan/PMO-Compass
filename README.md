## 📌 About the Project

**PMO Compass** bridges the productivity gap between overly complex tools like Jira/Azure DevOps and basic manual processes like spreadsheets. Designed with real stakeholder feedback from PwC, the app centralises project data, automates admin workflows, and visualises risk and progress — all while keeping the learning curve minimal.

### 🧠 Key Highlights

- Designed to solve **real challenges** faced by PMO teams in tech consulting.
- Features **automated Gantt charts**, **project clustering with NLP**, and **change request pipelines**.
- Implements clean **PwC-aligned branding**, and modern **UX patterns**.
- Developed using the **MERN Stack** with full CRUD functionality, RESTful APIs, and secure authentication.
